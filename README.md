# OpenHousing docs
OpenHousing is the working title for BrightHive's suite of Open Source Housing, Health, and Criminal Justice data products and services. 

## HSLynk & Standards
HSLynk is an Open Source data warehouse and platform for Homlessness Managment Information System (HMIS) data. A disambiguation of the many parts of HSLynk and it's documenation may be found on the repo: https://github.com/servinglynk/hmis-lynk-open-source-docs. There are many propritary HMIS systems as HUD requires local angencies working with homeless populations to store and report data using specific data standards. This is especially true of local agencies that HUD funds. 

HSLynk supports the [2016 HUD data standards](https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3824/hmis-data-dictionary/). Here are the relevant documents linked to from the 2016 HUD data standards:

+ [Data Dictionary](https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/HMIS-Data-Dictionary-2016.pdf)
+ [Data Manual](https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/HMIS-Data-Standards-Manual.pdf)
+ [2014 to 2016 Conversion Manual](https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/Instructions-for-Mapping-Existing-HMIS-Data-for-2014-Version-5-HMIS-Data-Standards-Elements.pdf)

_Note, there are also 2017 data standards, but those do not appear to be implemented in HSLynk yet._
